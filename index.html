        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>A large number of trees on a piece of land make up forests. They are a great source of oxygen as trees exhale a large amount of oxygen during the day and inhale carbon dioxide. This also helps in keeping the air pure and environment clean. Trees in forests help in maintaining ecological balance and biodiversity. Forests play an important role in maintaining cycles of evaporation and condensation that bring down rain.
        They are rich in medicinal value as well and their trees, roots and wood are used to prepare multiple medicines. Without forests, it is difficult to survive on earth. Activities of deforestation have reduced forests. Global warming is the result of reduced forests. Harmful rays of the sun – UV rays are easily passing through the ozone layer due to forest imbalance that affects the environment. We should plant more and more trees and protect forests. Save trees, save lives!</p>

        <h2>Section Two</h2>
        <p>Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the moon, trees, flowers, fruits, human beings, birds, animals, etc. In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy. For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another. Humans, for example, rely on nature for their survival, and nature provides us with oxygen, food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothing, among other things. Many shades may be seen in nature, contributing to the planet’s beauty. Along with humans, animals and birds also find their habitat and means of survival in nature. Therefore, it is essential to take proper care of our nature for maintaining a healthy life.</p>

        <h2>Section Three</h2>
        <p>Forests are essential for animals as well as for humans. Humans are dependent on forests for various reasons, and animals are dependent on forests for their habitat and survival. We get various types of fruits, vegetables, medicines, wood, oxygen, etc., from forests. Wild animals like lions, tigers, elephants, wolves, foxes, peacocks, giraffes, etc., live in forests, and their whole survival is dependent on forests and forest products. Forests bring us rain and maintain the balance in the environment. The ecosystem will be depleted with the depletion of forests. Therefore, it is essential to stop cutting down trees and save our forests.</p>
